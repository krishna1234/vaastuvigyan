                                                    physical issue for which one need doctor consultation for sure. In
                                                    practical, the doctor will not do any magic to make it good, he or she

                                                <p><strong>Power of Sub-conscious mind</strong></p>
                                                <p class="just">As per researches, it has been proved that human being can
                                                    experience all kinds of inputs or information through conscious mind by
                                                    two ways. The first way of getting inputs is through five sensory organs
                                                    namely eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. These sensory organs are
                                                    responsible for listening, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching and
                                                    based on which responding to the opponent. The second of way of
                                                    receiving input is from the sub-conscious state of mind. The duty of
                                                    sub-conscious is to pick up all the inputs and information from one’s
                                                    living environment. And it is the responsibility of sub-conscious to
                                                    create a link with the source of eternal happiness or joy within
                                                    oneself. So, if sub-conscious is not responding or may be clouded with
                                                    unnecessary non-relevant information which has no correlation with the
                                                    living space and working zone of a person, it proves that it is not
                                                    capable to connect him or her to experience joy or happiness within
                                                    oneself.</p><br />

                                                    after implementation of Vaastu Vigyan, either by just making few changes
                                                    within their homes or by opening a new gate or by shifting their
                                                    sleeping and working positions, the process of regaining all the assets
                                                    and vital energy is possible. One may have spent thousands of funds
                                                    unnecessarily but spending little money on Vaastu Vigyan implementation
                                                    will help them to regain their entire outflow back.</p>
