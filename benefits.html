                                        are topics many of us have strong feelings about. There are four main areas in
                                        which our negative beliefs about money affect our lives in harmful ways.</p>
                                    <br />

                                            <p class="just">We all want more money and more peace of mind in our lives,
                                                especially given all the uncertainties in the world today. The more
                                                chaotic the environment, the more we naturally want security and peace.
                                                We can have this and more. However, it means giving up old familiar ways
                                                of how we think about security. Letting go of what we know can be a tall
                                                order for some of us; even if it is the key to getting what we want.

                                                this disorder due to stress in their lives. Usually anxiety is a outcome
                                                of external forces, but at times people by themselves will get forced to
                                                experience anxious due to their inferiority complex. Such person will
                                                often say that all worst and bad things are happening only for them and
                                                restrict themselves from enjoyments. The worse fact about it is that
                                                such persons are not aware that it is just a mild disorder which can be

                                                    them. They are not comfortable even with themselves and they will
                                                    not trust people around them. With such mood, it is not possible for

                                            <p class="just">As per researches, it has been proved that human being can
                                                experience all kinds of inputs or information through conscious mind by
                                                two ways. The first way of getting inputs is through five sensory organs
                                                namely eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. These sensory organs are
                                                responsible for listening, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching and
                                                based on which responding to the opponent. The second of way of
                                                receiving input is from the sub-conscious state of mind. The duty of
                                                sub-conscious is to pick up all the inputs and information from one’s
                                                living environment. And it is the responsibility of sub-conscious to
                                                create a link with the source of eternal happiness or joy within
                                                oneself. So, if sub-conscious is not responding or may be clouded with
                                                unnecessary non-relevant information which has no correlation with the
                                                living space and working zone of a person, it proves that it is not
                                                capable to connect him or her to experience joy or happiness within
                                                oneself.</p><br />
