They have become a source of ridicule because they are in the hands of unscrupulous people. The local pundit perhaps succumbed in class IV while studying in School.

Think about this and you will know why this science got a bad name .why does it has gone thrive ? Because innocent humans are fascinated by Extraneous things â€“ Saffron clothes, knotted hair, wooden sandals, number of these do not have knowledge rather they often hide their foolishness behind these ornaments.
