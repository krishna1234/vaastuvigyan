                                        architecture and creation. It involves various elements which are highly
                                        desirable for the construction and maintenance of a happy and enjoyable balance
                                        between nature and man. It provides an ambient setting for man where he can
                                        aptly enjoy his work with his colleagues. It captivates the benefits of the
                                        natural elements and incorporates it aptly in our lives in order to help us
                                        enjoy enhanced benefits from life and work. It brings about joy, euphoria and
                                        harmony. The word Vaastu refers to the biological environment around us or any
                                        other thing that exists around our lives. These things or elements include our
                                        house, shelter and various other elements which depict the system of planning
                                        appropriately. Since the ancient times Vaastu Vigyan has been considered to be a
                                        vital aspect which is highly essential for town planning and architecture. Due
                                        to this reason this Vigyan is also known as the science of the directions f
                                        nature which incorporates all the five elements of nature. These include Earth,
                                        Air, Water, Fire and space. These elements are compiled to form the
                                        panchbhootas. It is strongly believed that the 9 planets are so placed due to
                                        the position and presence of the panchbhootas.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Make sure that there are three doorways (to the maximum) in a straight line.
                                            This is because; an un-appropriate position near your entrance can cause the
                                            deceleration of your level of prosperity to a considerable level.</li>
                                        <li>Ensure that the doors constructed, face either the south/southwest/west
                                            directions.</li>
                                        <li>The rooms, especially the rooms like drawing rooms should face the
                                            North/East direction.</li>
                                        <li>Always keep the North, North-East, East and the ‘Bramha-sthan’ proper, well
                                            maintained and without any heavy loads. On the contrary, try to keep the
                                            South, South-west and Western side of the room comparatively heavy.</li>
                                        <li>Ensure that your balconies, windows and the verandahs are
                                            North/North-east/East facing.</li>
                                        <li>The pillars present should be equal and even in their numbers and they
                                            shouldn’t be place near the Bramha-Sthan.</li>
                                        <li>Try to create an entrance gate which is larger than every other internal
                                            gate of your home/office/apartment. Entrance gate can be created in all
                                            other directions except the South-West one.</li>
                                        <li>Do not incorporate bonsai, milk producing plants, plants with rubber or
                                            cactus in your home, for avoiding serious ailments, relevant problems and
                                            tension in the long run.</li>
                                        <li>Under any and every circumstance, do not keep dysfunctional devices in your
                                            homes like a dysfunctional watch, pen, telephone, mobile phone,
                                            mixer-grinder, radio, improper ball point pens and cassettes in your homes.
                                            These dysfunctional items can cause the presence of negative energy in your
                                            homes thereby reducing and decreasing the level of prosperity and harmony.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Try not to accept money in the middle of your two fingers, as it is believed
                                            that this process can decrease the further advent of wealth. Always try to
                                            accept or take the money using your five fingers.</li>

                                        <li>Thoroughly check the sound coming from your door-bell. An irritating or
                                            displeasing sound can ruin the mood of the members of your family, thereby
                                            vexing them. Again, a dull sound aptly decreases and affects the energy
                                            level of your home. Make sure that the sound of the door bell is pleasing
                                            and soothing, simultaneously.</li>
                                        <li>A broken tile, floor or even marbles can be the main and a significant cause
                                            for improper and broken relationships between the members of your family.
                                            Try to cover the broken part with a cloth or a carpet of relevant sort in
                                            order to procure an immediate solution to your problem.</li>
                                        <li>Any electric pole or even a tree before your entrance gate or any of the
                                            windows can cause serious and improper health for your family members.
                                            Incorporate a convex mirror on the external wall in the direction of the
                                            telephone pole or tree in order to save your family from bad omens.</li>
                                        <li>Incorporate a number plate and the name of your residence on the entrance
                                            gate for allowing opportunities to reach you easily. You can even light the
                                            name nameplate for better and more long lasting benefits.</li>
                                        <li>Do not sit in a position which faces your back to the entrance gate in order
                                            to avoid cheating, deceit and betrayal in your life. In fact, always make
                                            sure that your unwanted guests are given that position in the home.</li>
                                        <li>The mental condition of your family members can be at stake if a toilet or
                                            fireplace is created in the North-East direction of your home. This can even
                                            expedite your tensions and problems. Always try to use initially energized
                                            pyramids, blue bulbs, green creepers and yellow towels for lowering the
                                            level of ill omens and effects.</li>
                                        <li>Try to always keep the mirrors of your home clean and free from any
                                            dust/dirt whatsoever, as, it might ruin the competence of the mirrors.
                                            Ensure fresh paint work from time to time along with apt repairs of the
                                            leaking taps and dysfunctional bulbs as soon as possible. Also try to keep
                                            your windows clean, thereby getting rid of broken glass or glasses with
                                            cracks quickly.</li>
                                        <li>Water, especially water which is moving lures positive energy coupled with
                                            monetary benefits. Try to face a small, decorative fountain or even an

                                        <li>Make sure that the temple in your office does not face the posterior side of the seat of the office owner. Also try to keep the central portion of your office vacant.</li>
                                        <li>The seat of the owner should face the north. The positive magnetic portion of the north exhibits sharp memory and helps you to enjoy a better and stronger power of grasping which in turn helps you to take correct and proper decisions while negotiating with potential customers. West is also a lucrative option in this regard, however, always to avoid south.</li>
                                        <li>The office owner should always sit a proper and strong wall in his posterior portion which again is the farthest portion of the gate in order to procure holistic support from office colleagues, seniors and friends. Owners should never face their back from their main gates and unwanted guests and acquaintances should be given similar seats. A seat of similar sort decreases the strength of an individual and expedites his fears and insecurities.</li>
                                        <li>Make sure that the owner’s desk is always a rectangular one.
