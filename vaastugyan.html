                                            Vaastu Vigyan is actually the science which bears the ethics of planning,
                                            architecture and creation. It involves various elements which are highly
                                            desirable for the construction and maintenance of a happy and enjoyable balance
                                            between nature and man. It provides an ambient setting for man where he can
                                            aptly enjoy his work with his colleagues. It captivates the benefits of the
                                            natural elements and incorporates it aptly in our lives in order to help us
                                            enjoy enhanced benefits from life and work. It brings about joy, euphoria and
                                            harmony. The word Vaastu refers to the biological environment around us or any
                                            other thing that exists around our lives. These things or elements include our
                                            house, shelter and various other elements which depict the system of planning
                                            appropriately. Since the ancient times Vaastu Vigyan has been considered to be a
                                            vital aspect which is highly essential for town planning and architecture. Due
                                            to this reason this Vigyan is also known as the science of the directions f
                                            nature which incorporates all the five elements of nature. These include Earth,
                                            Air, Water, Fire and space. These elements are compiled to form the
                                            panchbhootas. It is strongly believed that the 9 planets are so placed due to
                                            the position and presence of the panchbhootas.

                                            Many individuals strongly believe that these panchbhootas comprise our world as

                                            Water which is also known as jal is said to be another vital element of the
                                            panchbhootas. The river, rain and water bodies symbolize water. The water might
                                            be in any form. It can be solid, liquid or gaseous form simultaneously. The
                                            water forms a vital form of all plants and animals hence it is absolutely vital
                                            in our lives. Physical life exists only in the area which has proper sources of

                                            Air is the most powerful element of our lives which deals with our health and
                                            our physical bodies. Air or vaayu provides us with the facilities to respire.
                                            The oxygen present in the air is highly essential for respiring. Apart from
                                            oxygen, nitrogen, carbon-di-oxide and various other inert gases like argon,
                                            krypton, helium, and neon are also present in the air in varying proportions.
                                            Dust particles are also present in the air in specific amounts. Pure air
                                            containing oxygen is highly essential for our brains and also for respiration.
                                            The physical comfort of the human beings is highly dependent on the air,
                                            humidity and the amount of temperature in the air.

                                            represented with the help of fire. Without the presence of fire these sub

                                            <li>Make sure that the temple in your office does not face the posterior side of the seat of the office owner. Also try to keep the central portion of your office vacant.</li>
                                            <li>The seat of the owner should face the north. The positive magnetic portion of the north exhibits sharp memory and helps you to enjoy a better and stronger power of grasping which in turn helps you to take correct and proper decisions while negotiating with potential customers. West is also a lucrative option in this regard, however, always to avoid south.</li>
                                            <li>The office owner should always sit a proper and strong wall in his posterior portion which again is the farthest portion of the gate in order to procure holistic support from office colleagues, seniors and friends. Owners should never face their back from their main gates and unwanted guests and acquaintances should be given similar seats. A seat of similar sort decreases the strength of an individual and expedites his fears and insecurities.</li>
                                            <li>Make sure that the owner’s desk is always a rectangular one. Also, try to incorporate a crystal globe facing the North-West corner of your table for procuring myriad offers from foreign clients. Also, rotate it at least thrice a day in a clockwise direction. In order to enhance the number of your prospective clients place your address book in the northwest corner of your desk. Moreover, you can also install 6 chimes or yellow rods in the North-Western area of your office in order to bring a huge number of clients for imports and exports in the overseas.</li>
                                            <li>Keep the picture of a high altitude mountain the southwest corner of the room in order to avoid calamities and instabilities.</li>
                                            <li>Ensure that your office does not have any broken marble as this can lead to broken relationships with your prospective clients and customers. Hide the broken part of the marble by a carpet. You can also fix it accordingly.</li>
                                            <li>In order to expedite sales tie three coins with a red thread and incorporate it with your book for invoice.</li>
                                            <li>A conference room or bedroom should always face the East/West direction. While taking new decisions, make sure that you face the Eastern side, as it will help you rise like the rising sun. West is a lucrative direction for analyzing your targets.</li>
                                            <li>Ensure that you have a south-west direction in your home office. I the south-west direction is not available for you then you can easily opt for the North-West direction.</li>

It is divided into two segments, the left and right. The left side of the brain is responsible for decisions related to logical reasoning and the right side take decisions with emotions. When these two sides clash with one another to deliver a unanimous decision, peace disappears from your mind. Next, you are going to discuss the impact of poor vaastu accountable for mental turbulence. Do you sleep with your head resting towards north direction?

When your heart is under constant turmoil, it is to be assumed that you are not happy in life. But, the root of the turmoil can be figured from vaastu perspective. Claustrophobic and closed atmosphere gives lonely feeling which cut off connections with the outer world. Try to clear out your home by removing unwanted materials, let the air and light to play inside. This will soothe your heart. According to vaastu principles, the southern direction should be more open, i.e. it should have more doors and windows, and less in north directions because this brings gloominess and stress.

Non compatibility may have resulted due to faulty designs and placements of your private rooms. The fire area evokes heats of clashes; therefore it is better to stay away from the place except when you want to get rid of cold. Besides, other interiors like wall colors, home decors, wall hangings and entrance of the room matters a lot. When a water tap is placed near the direction of fire place, it raises misunderstandings. The kitchen setup like the gas, oven, water sink etc, should be placed according to vaastu to get a happy married life.
