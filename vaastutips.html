                                                traditional, glamorous, romantic or modern, but there is one thing that
                                                remains the same. Every dining is (or rather should be) built according
                                                to the norms set by vastu for dining room. If the interiors of the area
                                                are not designed as per this system, your perfect space will transform
                                                into a depressing, bad-luck creator. Here are a few tips that will help
                                                you create an atmosphere which is not just perfect for meals but also
                                                for attracting prosperity and luck.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">The evolutionary transition of our society from 'traditional'
                                        to 'modern' has led to some drastic changes in house structures and designing.
                                        One of such changes is the invention of septic tanks. Septic tanks are
                                        economical, environmentally friendly and effective private sewage treatment
                                        plants. However, like every other component of a house structure, they too must
                                        be built according to vaastu for septic tank.

                                        <li>The bathroom pipes and toilet pipes must be diverted to the north-west or

                                        <li>The garage must always be built in the southeast or northwest of a house.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>When designing a garage make sure at least three feet of walking space is
                                            left inside after the car is parked. This ensures free movement of air and
                                            light.</li>
                                        <li>The car shed must never touch the compound wall or building.</li>
                                        <li>Preferably, the garage gate should face east or north. It is important to
                                            make sure that the height of the gate is not more than the height of the
                                            main gate of the house (affixed at the compound wall). Also, the gate must
                                            open freely, without any obstruction.</li>
                                        <li>Trash or inflammable material must never be stored inside a garage.</li>
                                        <li>The floor in the garage should slope towards the eastern or northern
                                            direction.</li>

                                        <li>If you place your car in the west side of a northwest located garage, you
                                            will undergo a lot of traveling.</li>
                                        <li>If a car is parked in the southwestern corner, it will require slight repair
                                            work on a regular basis.</li>
                                        <li>Never park a car in the northeastern direction. This is because northeast is
                                            where the heavenly forces flow; a parked car would block these forces.
                                            However, at the same time, if the garage is in the basement, parking in the
                                            northeastern side is permitted.</li>
                                        <li>A garage located in the southwest would mean rare usage of the vehicle and
                                            constant repairing.</li>
                                        <li>When parking, always park the vehicle with its front facing east or north.
                                            This will guarantee that the vehicle would never get worked up.</li>
                                        <li>If you park the car facing west or south side, possibilities are that the
                                            car will face fire hazards.</li>

                                        The smallest of articles can make a huge difference in the way your luck runs
                                        for you. Doors and windows are not merely passages for insulation or for people
                                        to enter but are also gateways for positive and negative energies to come into
                                        the house. If a window is designed incorrectly in the wrong direction, it can
                                        pave way for the negative energies to come in and spell disaster for the
                                        inhabitants. Conversely, if the doors and windows are constructed in the right
                                        direction, they can bring in a lot of prosperity and luck.

                                    <p class="card-text">Here are a few tips which need to be kept in mind when
                                        designing the doors and windows according to vaastu for house:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>According to vaastu for house structure, a house must at all times have even
                                            numbers of windows and doors (e.g. 2, 4, 6, 8, etc).</li>
                                        <li>When fixing the windows and doors, it is important to keep cross-ventilation
                                            in mind. Also, it’s essential to fix windows and doors opposite to one
                                            another to allow more light and air to enter.</li>
                                        <li>Doors must never be placed at the center of a wall.</li>
                                        <li>South facing houses must have north facing entrances so that they fall at
                                            the eastern half.</li>
                                        <li>North facing houses must have north facing entrances so that they fall at
                                            the eastern half of the side.</li>
                                        <li>West facing houses must have their entrance towards West, to make sure the
                                            main door falls at the Northern half of the side.</li>
                                        <li>The entrance for east facing houses must be fixed towards East, to make sure
                                            the main door falls towards the Northern half of the side.</li>
                                        <li>The main gates of two houses facing each other must never open towards each
                                            other. Doors such as these are very inauspicious.</li>
                                        <li>Teak is the best wood for making doors and windows.</li>
                                        <li>Square or uneven furnishing articles must be avoided.</li>
                                        <li>All the windows must have symmetry and must be proportionate in height.</li>
                                        <li>There must be absolutely no obstruction, such as plants, Temple, staircases,
                                            and the like, in front of the main entrance.</li>
                                        <li>Construct doors in the beginning and end of a staircase. For detailed

                                        <li>Always begin your stairs from north to south or east to west. A turn can

                                        <li>The vertical set of stairs should also have an odd number and when divided

                                            high blood pressure, undiagnosed diseases, anemia and the like.</li>
